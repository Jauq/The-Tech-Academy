### C# Exercises & Minor Projects
Within this collection of folders and files you will find everything I had made in Visual Studio revolving around C#.
This includes but is not limited to: All of the code that I copied in order to learn how Classes (Abstract, Static, etc.), Inheritance, Enums, Structs, Variables, Constants, Arrays, Lists, Booleans, Iteration, Lambda Expressions, Other Data Types, Exception Handling, Methods (Functions), and IO.
I also went into the basics of the MVC (Database-First) webstite model, and made a Twenty-One (BlackJack) game using the console.
For the majority of the back-end code I copied the instructors instructions, however I did customize more of the visual aspects, but not very much.

### C# Projects
In here you will find three distinct Projects.

The first being named "Contoso University". This is what I had created from the following the instructions found here:

* [Microsoft Code-First MVC Tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/getting-started/getting-started-with-ef-using-mvc/creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application)

It is a Code-First MVC project that revolves around an interface that can be used to keep track of a university, which includes Students, Grades, Instructors, Classes, Departments and Budgets.
Note: I did not write any of this code myself, I merely copied it.

The Second is named "Knockout." This file contains my experimentation with the Knockout.js library. I wasn't given any particualr task other than to make something with this library so if you decide to run it you will find a simple list. You can add and remove names from it and get info on the names listed. It doesn't survive refreshes because there is no database.

The Third is named "QuotesForCarInsurance." This is an Database-First MVC project where the user can input their details about their car and recieve a quote based on those parameters. My only instructions were a list of parameters I needed to get from the user and a bunch of rules for calculating price, all of the code, back-end and front-end, was developed by me.
