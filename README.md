This repository is the grand collection of code that I had programmed myself or copied from an instructor while attending The Tech Academy.

### C# Exercises & Minor Projects
Within this collection of folders and files you will find everything I had made in Visual Studio revolving around C#.
This includes but is not limited to: All of the code that I copied in order to learn how Classes (Abstract, Static, etc.), Inheritance, Enums, Structs, Variables, Constants, Arrays, Lists, Booleans, Iteration, Lambda Expressions, Other Data Types, Exception Handling, Methods (Functions), and IO.
I also went into the basics of the MVC (Database-First) webstite model, and made a Twenty-One (BlackJack) game using the console.
For the majority of the back-end code I copied the instructors instructions, however I did customize more of the visual aspects, but not very much.

### C# Projects
In here you will find three distinct Projects.

The first being named "Contoso University". This is what I had created from the following the instructions found here:

* [Microsoft Code-First MVC Tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/getting-started/getting-started-with-ef-using-mvc/creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application)

It is a Code-First MVC project that revolves around an interface that can be used to keep track of a university, which includes Students, Grades, Instructors, Classes, Departments and Budgets.
Note: I did not write any of this code myself, I merely copied it.

The Second is named "Knockout." This file contains my experimentation with the Knockout.js library. I wasn't given any particualr task other than to make something with this library so if you decide to run it you will find a simple list. You can add and remove names from it and get info on the names listed. It doesn't survive refreshes because there is no database.

The Third is named "QuotesForCarInsurance." This is an Database-First MVC project where the user can input their details about their car and recieve a quote based on those parameters. My only instructions were a list of parameters I needed to get from the user and a bunch of rules for calculating price, all of the code, back-end and front-end, was developed by me.

### HTML & CSS Projects
This is a small collection of HTML and CSS files that I copied from instructors at The Tech Academy. There isn't anything too special about them, all they did was teach me the basics. I downloaded all images off of the Tech Academy LMS Website.

The most impressive project would have to simply be the one named "index.html" as this ones is a single page website surrounded around the idea of taking a vacation to space. It even comes with pictures and some input boxes where you could theoretically start to set up a vaction, of course it is all fictional and was made entirely for the purpose of instruction.

### JavaScript Exercises & Minor Projects
Like the HTML & CSS Projects, these files were copied from instructors at The Tech Academy. They aren't individually interesting, they just taught me the basics of JavaScript when combined with HTML and CSS.

The most interesting project would have to be a file named "get_val_and_cal.html." It is simply a calculator built into the browser. Though it's limitations are clear, it will only take two whole numbers, and give you a single answer rounded to the nearest hundreth.

### Javascript Project Pizza Ordering
This project in partiular is an interesting one. I didn't copy any code from The Tech Academy instructors this time, instead I was given some rules, and a desired outcome. The rules being how much do pizza sizes and toppings cost, and the outcome to be a working web app that can display the price of a selected pizza. The file named "index.html" was my original design, complete with auto price calculation and a very basic design built with bootstrap. The file named "alt-index.html" is identical except that the price doesn't auto-calculate and you must press the "place order" button to do so. Overall this project is a good example of what I can do with my Javascript skills.

### Live Project
The Live Project is a special project from the Tech Academy. I, and some other attendees, worked on an MVC Code-first project for the tech academy using Azure DevOps. During this time, The Tech Academy taught me how to work in a large team where everyone works on the same project, and also how to maneuver through and properly use Azure DevOps.

The project itself is a dashboard for The Tech Academy. A website that allows them and their attendees to keep track of progress on their job hunt.

In this repository I specifically go over certain stories that I personally worked on and found the solutions too, and since I cannot bring the entire project into my repository for obvious reasons, I have included screenshots of the project with notes and comments of what I worked on.

### SQL Exercises
Here is a collection of SQL code. The files whose names start with "SQLQueryBasics" was code that I copied from The Tech Academy instructors, but the files whose names start with "SQLDrill" was code that I wrote myself following certain requirements from The Tech Academy. I also wrote the code for the Adventure Works SQL file, following requirements as I did with the drills.

### SQL Library Managment System Project
This project, while similar to the SQL Exercises, is quite different. While I had worked with pre-built databases in SQL Exercises, here I needed to fill out my own database following certain rules (The database tables and columns were told to me, but I filled out the data myself). This repository does not have the database in it, but the code has all the necesarry components to build the database I made. It also has stored procedures at the end which needed to be made based on certain requirements.
